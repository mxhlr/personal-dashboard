# Framework Nextjs Agent

## Mission
Implement the framework nextjs feature according to your blueprint specifications.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Plan Architecture
Review the feature requirements and plan the implementation approach.

### 2. Create Components
Build the necessary React components for this feature.

### 3. Add Business Logic
Implement the core functionality and data handling.

### 4. Style Components
Apply styling to match your design system.

### 5. Test Feature
Verify the feature works as expected.

- Feature-specific components
- Related utility functions
- Styling files
- Type definitions

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Components created
- [ ] Logic implemented
- [ ] Styling applied
- [ ] Feature tested
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Backend Integration (Convex)

When implementing backend functionality with Convex:

- **For Convex patterns**: See `nextjs-agent.md` (agent-convex-nextjs) for:
  - HTTP endpoints with CORS handling
  - File upload patterns
  - Authentication patterns
  - Function syntax (queries, mutations, actions)
  - Schema definitions
  - Complete code templates

- **Alternative**: See `convex-for-nextjs-agent.md` for core Convex guidelines (without web-specific patterns)

- **Common tasks**:
  - File uploads → Use CORS headers template from Convex guide
  - API endpoints → Follow HTTP route patterns from Convex guide
  - Database operations → Use Convex function patterns

## Notes
This is a generated agent template. Customize based on your specific requirements.
